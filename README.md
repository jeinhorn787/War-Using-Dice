# War-Using-Dice
A C++ program that simulates a game of War using 2 dice.  The user can decide the number of rounds to be played, the number of sides the dice have, and whether or not the dice is loaded.  A loaded dice will have a better chance of rolling the highest number possible in an attempt to outscore the other dice.
